Really thank Rajthilak sir for this informative video. Please don't think bad about this message sir. Nothing personal.

But i am requesting to Nitish Sir (CampusX creator), sir you itself please create videos for the channel.

As u r the USP (unique selling proposition) in this channel.

- As the way u speak
- The way u  breakdown the concept
- the best way of writing in iPad instead of slides.
These are really awesome style of teaching.

Fact:
All the people good in technology can't teach. It's a special quality. 
A best surgeon need not be a Lecturer and vice versa.

So instead of anyone else. Even founder of these concepts are not needed.

We need ONLY NITISH Sir.

Project title: Using Visualisation and Machine Learning Technologies to predict the length of stay for patients when admitted to hospitals
Description:
Extended lengths of hospital stay are a serious drain on hospital resources, and the ability to predict the length-of-stay for each patient at the time of admission would bring various benefits for the NHS, mainly for hospitals resource management and planning. The development of efficient prediction tools will improve scheduling activities associated with the usage of wards and hospital beds, creating a positive impact on the scheduling of elective surgeries based on the expected availabilities of beds [1]. It is believed that the length of stay explains 85 to 90 percent of the variation in hospital costs between patients [2].
The aim of this project is to create a model that predicts the length-of-stay for each patient at time of admission based on their information available at the Connected Bradford dataset. A fully developed model would have the potential to answer questions such as:
“Will the patient have a “long” stay at the hospital (> 5 days) or short (≤ 5 days) as determined at the point that they enter hospital”.
“Can we use this model to predict what investigations will be performed in A&E from earlier data”
The development of an AI system for the reliable prediction of the length-of-stay requires access to different patient’s data, which could include patient’s diagnosis information (e.g. possibly based on the Major Diagnostic Category), age, gender, marital status, race, previous admission and discharge info, procedures, diagnoses, etc.
Workplan: Develop enhanced understanding of Stakeholders Requirements and Standard

The confidence interval does not tell you how probable something lying inside our outside the interval is.
Confidence intervals are a frequentist figure and therefore once you have a confidence interval, it either covers the mean or it doesn't. There's no probability involved anymore.

So a 95% confidence level does NOT mean that 95% of the sample data lies within the confidence interval.
It also does NOT mean there is a 95% probability that new sample data will fall into the confidence interval.
It also does NOT mean there is a 95% probability that the true mean will fall into the confidence interval.
It's not even a definitive range of plausible values. In fact, large ranges of a confidence interval could be completely impossible.

The 95% and 5% are about the selection of the confidence interval (which is random), not about the data (which is fixed).
So a 95% confidence level means that if hundreds of scientists repeated this experiment and calculated a 95% confidence interval, then on average 95% of those intervals would contain the population mean. 5% of the intervals would not.

NULL Hypothesis is the opposite of what we are supposedly trying to figure out.
If it says there is a difference, the null hypothesis would be there is no difference.
If the general hypothesis is that the coronavirus is killing 1000 people a day,
the NULL hypothesis is that it is not killing 1000 people a day.... it could be less or more but not 1000...

Have I understood it right?

The NULL hypothesis hypothesizes :P 
that there is no difference between the two drugs.

If we see that the results are more or less consistent:

for example if the difference in the recovery time between drug A and drug B is somewhat consistent, ignoring random factors (that cannot be explained) - 
It basically means that the NULL hypothesis can be rejected i.e there IS a difference between the two drugs and how they affect the recovery.

If we see that small changes result in switching the difference in recovery in favour of one of the other, we FAIL to reject the NULL Hypothesis i.e 
THERE IS NO Difference or very little difference between the two drugs and how they affect the recovery.

Till now me &amp; my other batchmates are still waiting to receive the certificate from IIT Ropar. The content of the course at the end was so tough that I couldn&#39;t complete as well they gave less time on it. There were 2 hackathon held which were below par. When I started appearing for interviews, I found that the course content is only useful if you are applying for Data Analyst post at Junior level or entry level that too not in most of the big 4 or faang or maang or renowned product based companies. If you are targeting for Data Scientist or ML roles or Data Engineer roles, pls take your experience into consideration in that field previously as well as do a free course. Build your knowledge from intership or YouTube. Don&#39;t do this course or this type of courses. You will be disappointed. Believe me. I am still paying my loan for this course &amp; it hurts. I bagged a new job as a Data Analyst on my own effort bagging only 13lpa package. The work is good. I applied to 219 companies &amp; appearing for only 11 interviews within 2 months after completing this course. I had high hopes from this course &amp; it&#39;s outcome but I regret it. But now I am atleast happy that my misconceptions are cleared. Now I will not make the same mistake again. Now through my work I understand what is required to get into DS / DE / DA / ML / AI domain.

I use to explain things to myself to see whether I have understood it really. It really works.

I would also add something else on top.
I did some further research when i entered university and found two techniques that goes in line with the feynman techniques.

Those are active recall and spaces repetition.

Active recall is basically the act of retrieving knowledge that you have acquired. 
You turn your notes into a list of questions.
For instance
What is feature engineering?
what is feature transformation?
What are the types of feature transformation?
Why feature scaling is important?
How feature scaling is done?

Then, instead of reviewing your notes. You review the questions. You test to see if you still understand (and can explain it clearly as in the feynman technique)

Then, there is spaced repetition. This is the act of doing active recalling at spaced intervals.
For example, if you are able to answer a question during active recalling, 
you can review that question after 2 weeks
if you are not able to answer a question, you must relearn and try answering it after 1 week.

Basically, it is about testing yourself on your notes(that you have converted into what, how and why questions).
But you are testing yourself more frequently on things that you have not mastered.

Now you must be saying all that is good but the system seems difficult to implement. 
It isn't.  There is the Anki app that does all the hardwork for you automatically.
You just need to put your questions and answers in the app.
Then, based on how you respond to the question(was it easy, hard, very hard)
it will automatically to the spaced repetition for you.
There are lots of videos on active recalling, spaced repetition and anki app.
Try look for it and see for yourself.
It worked amazingly for me to learn and make things stick.",none,5,2022-08-29T16:46:55Z,2022-08-29T16:49:01Z,True,1.0,True,Güzel Bir Bhai

I am confused is iterator and iterable both point to the same object?  if points to the same object then why when I delete iterable and its iterator can not be accessed. one more thing is that iterator is not scriptable.thanks,Good video! still confused is  iterator a reference to the iterable from which the iterator is generated ? why iterator and its iterable have difference ids? when I modify iterable the changes appear in the iterator but when I del iterable then its iterator is gone off.

_(3-D Example below, but it generalizes pretty intuitively imo)_ 

1) *Linear Transformations and Matrix Multiplication→* Multiplying two matrices can be conceptualized as applying one linear transformation after another. I will make sense of the dot product in this context.

2) *Column Space→* The non-square vector on the right side of the dot product has column space one(rank = 1); thus, applying it as a linear transformation will shrink your original vector down into 1-dimensional space. → This is what Grant was getting at using û as the basis vector for 1-dimensional space.

The non-square matrix on the right can be conceptualized as just 1 basis vector(û) with 3 coordinates of landing.

4) *Dot Product→* Conceptualized as the projection of a 3-d vector onto 1-d space(the right matrix) where the product of transformed basis vectors(left matrix * right matrix) determines the extent to which each dimension contributes.

*What this means→ *
1) The dot product represents the extent to which 2-vectors combine in each dimension, represented by a singular value.

It is not coherent with other manipulations, like matrix - matrix multiplication, and doesn&#39;t explain clearly what it is the result we get. Let me share my explanation of what dot product actually is. Dot product is a special case of matrix-matrix multiplication, that translates a vector to 1-dimensional space. If we multiply w and v, then the result is orientation and magnitude of projection of the vector w on vector v expressed in units of this new space. The implication of this understanding is very broad - it better explains and makes coherent other concepts, like null spaces, determinants, asf. It makes also the way how dot product is calculated immediately obvious. Let&#39;s try this, please. As it was said, matrix multiplication changes orientation and length of unit vectors. On the example of this video, try to project i-hat and j-hat onto second vectors. Specify the unit vector as equal to projection of j-hat and 1/3 of i-hat. And now, observe, what is the magnitude of projection of w on v expressed in units of v, and how you would calculate it without knowing, how to perform dot product. It is self-explanatory, do you agree? The missing part is base unit of this new dimension. If we get it, then everything is very simple. Also, i said, that dot product is a special case of matrix multiplication. If we understand matrix multiplication as switching from one space defined by some set of coordinates to another space defined by another set of coordinates, then this is obvious, that what we need is a series of dot products in order to project coordinates from first space to coordinates of second space. Another implication, that simplifies a lot, is that by any transformation the observed object, f.i. a vector, doesn&#39;t change. The way we perceive the object in new space changes, the object is still the same. And this is coherent with the observation from real world. Let&#39;s say, that we observe two trees. If we come closer to the trees, they don&#39;t become bigger, but their magnitude in our new point of observation. When we come closer and we specify our distance to the trees as the same number of units, then those units becomes smaller, and the height of the trees expressed in those new units is bigger. If we change the angle of observation, then we change the projection of distance between the trees projected on the coordinate that is perpendicular to our direction to the trees, but the real distance between the trees stays the same. If we stay in line with the trees, we are able to see only the first tree, the second tree and all trees that are inline land in null space. We can&#39;t see them, but it doesn&#39;t mean, that they doesn&#39;t exist. We can also try something else. Let&#39;s take a pen, keep it in hand and close your one eye. Then, keep the pen in the same place, but move you head and watch the pen from different angles and from different distances. The pen is all the time the same, but it&#39;s perceived orientation and length changes. This is what we get performing dot product.","Hi 3Blue1Brown!
